# Multi-label-classification_Irrigation_Machine
The objetive of this project is to to automate the watering of farm parcels by making an intelligent irrigation machine using neural networks. Multi-label classification problems differ from multi-class problems in that each observation can be labeled with zero or more classes. So classes/labels are not mutually exclusive, you could water all, none or any combination of farm parcels based on the inputs. Additionaly, we have tuned this neural network in two different ways, the first one ,changing the hyperparameters and the second one changing layers and neurons
